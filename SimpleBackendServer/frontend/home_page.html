        <h1>Federal Income Tax Laws</h1>

        <h2>1. Taxable Income</h2>
        <p>The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) defines taxable income as gross income minus allowable deductions and
            exemptions. Gross income includes all income from whatever source derived, unless specifically excluded by
            law. Deductions and exemptions are permitted for certain expenses and dependents, subject to various
            limitations and rules.</p>

        <h2>2. Tax Rates and Brackets</h2>
        <p>The IRC establishes a system of progressive tax rates, where tax rates increase as taxable income increases.
            Taxpayers are assigned to tax brackets based on their filing status (e.g., single, married filing jointly,
            head of household) and income level. The tax rates and brackets are periodically adjusted for inflation.</p>

        <h2>3. Standard Deduction and Itemized Deductions</h2>
        <p>Taxpayers can choose to claim either the standard deduction or itemize their deductions, whichever results in
            a lower taxable income. The standard deduction is a fixed amount set by law, while itemized deductions
            include expenses such as mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charitable contributions, and medical
            expenses.</p>

        <h2>4. Tax Credits</h2>
        <p>The IRC provides for various tax credits that directly reduce a taxpayer's federal income tax liability.
            Common tax credits include the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Child Tax Credit, education credits, and
            energy-efficient home credits. Tax credits are generally more valuable than deductions because they reduce
            tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis.</p>

        <h2>5. Withholding and Estimated Tax Payments</h2>
        <p>Employers are required to withhold federal income tax from employees' wages and remit it to the IRS on their
            behalf. Additionally, self-employed individuals and others with income not subject to withholding must make
            estimated tax payments throughout the year to cover their tax liability.</p>

        <h2>6. Tax Filing and Payment</h2>
        <p>Taxpayers must file their federal income tax returns annually by the due date, usually April 15th of the
            following year. Payment of any tax owed is also due by this date. Extensions to file may be available upon
            request, but any tax owed must still be paid by the original due date to avoid penalties and interest.</p>

        <h2>7. Tax Penalties and Interest</h2>
        <p>The IRC imposes penalties and interest on taxpayers who fail to comply with tax laws, including failure to
            file a return, failure to pay tax owed, and underpayment of estimated tax. Penalties and interest accrue
            from the due date of the return or the date of the underpayment, whichever is later.</p>

        <h2>8. Taxpayer Rights and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Taxpayers have certain rights under the IRC, including the right to challenge IRS determinations, appeal
            decisions, and receive prompt and courteous treatment. Taxpayers are also responsible for keeping accurate
            records, reporting income correctly, and filing timely and accurate tax returns.</p>
